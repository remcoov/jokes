/**
 * Craft plugins are very much like little applications in and of themselves. We’ve made
 * it as simple as we can, but the training wheels are off. A little prior knowledge is
 * going to be required to write a plugin.
 *
 * For the purposes of the plugin docs, we’re going to assume that you know PHP and SQL,
 * as well as some semi-advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and PHP namespaces.
